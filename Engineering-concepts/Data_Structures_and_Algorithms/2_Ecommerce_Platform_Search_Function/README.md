Understand the Problem:

* In an e-commerce platform, users frequently search for products by name, ID, or category.
* Efficient search is crucial to provide fast results, especially when dealing with thousands or millions of products.
* Choosing the right search algorithm and data structure helps reduce loading times and improves user experience.
* Algorithms are analyzed using asymptotic notations like Big O to understand their performance as data size grows.
* Big O notation helps estimate the worst-case time complexity, which is critical for ensuring the system performs well under load.
* Search operations can behave differently depending on:

  * Best case – when the item is found quickly (e.g., at the beginning).
  * Average case – when the item is somewhere in the middle.
  * Worst case – when the item is not found or at the end of the dataset.
* Binary search is ideal for sorted data, while linear search is simpler and works on unsorted data.

Analysis (Linear Search vs Binary Search):

* Linear Search checks each item one by one:

  * It works well for small or unsorted datasets.
  * Its performance degrades as the dataset grows.
  * Time complexity is O(n) in the worst case.

* Binary Search divides the search space in half at each step:

  * It is much faster on large datasets, provided the data is sorted.
  * It has a consistent O(log n) time complexity.
  * Sorting is a one-time cost, after which searches are highly efficient.

* For an e-commerce platform with a large catalog:

  * Binary Search is the better choice when data can be kept sorted.
  * For temporary or dynamic datasets, Linear Search may be used where sorting is impractical.
  * In real systems, further optimization includes indexes, caching, or search engines like Elasticsearch.
